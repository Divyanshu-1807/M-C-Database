## Todo List

You're given some existing HTML for a Todo List app.

### Requirements

- **Add New Tasks**: Implement functionality to add new tasks when the "Submit" button is clicked.
- **Clear Input Field**: Ensure that the `<input>` field is cleared upon successful addition of a task.
- **Remove Tasks**: Allow tasks to be removed from the Todo List by clicking the "Delete" button.

### Notes
- The focus of this task is on functionality, not styling. There is no need to write any custom CSS.
- You may modify the markup (e.g., adding IDs, data attributes, replacing some tags, etc.), but the visual output should remain the same.
- Consider ways to improve the user experience of the application. Implementing enhancements may earn you bonus credit during interviews.
