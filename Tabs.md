## Tabs Component

### Overview
Build a tabs component that displays one panel of content at a time, depending on the active tab element. The provided example includes some basic HTML contents.

### Requirements
- **Tab Activation**: Clicking on a tab should make it the active tab.
- **Visual Indicator**: Highlight the active tab (e.g., by changing its text color to blue) to differentiate it from non-active tabs.
- **Panel Display**: Only one panel's contents should be displayed at a time â€” the one corresponding to the active tab.

### Notes
- The focus is on functionality, not styling. There's no need for custom CSS except for highlighting the active tab.
- You may modify the HTML markup (e.g., adding `ids`, `data-attributes`, replacing tags, etc.) and use client-side rendering.
- Consider ways to improve the user experience. Implementing such enhancements can earn bonus points during interviews.
